# Getting started â€” Installation

You can install Spiral components independently or use a
pre-build [application skeleton](https://github.com/spiral/app), which enables most of the framework functions. You can 
either downgrade Web skeleton or use the CLI skeleton with minimal number dependencies to start a new application.

Installation includes the following packages out of the box and framework-specific functions enabled:

- [roadrunner-bridge](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-bridge)
- [cycle-bridge](https://github.com/spiral/cylce-bridge)
- [spiral/nyholm-bridge](https://github.com/spiral/nyholm-bridge)
