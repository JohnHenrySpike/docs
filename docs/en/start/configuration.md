# Getting started â€” Configuration

The Spiral Framework makes it super easy to set up your application with config files. All the config files live in the
`app/config` directory, and they let you configure things like connection to a database, set up cache storage, and
manage sessions, etc.

You don't even have to create any config files yourself, because the Spiral Framework comes with a default setup. But if
you want to, you can also use environment variables to change the main parameters of your application.

> **Note**
> Caching the config files is not necessary as they are only loaded once during application bootstrapping and not
> reloaded unless the application is restarted.

## Environment Variables

Using environment variables is a great way to separate the configuration of your application from the code itself. This
makes it easy to change certain options depending on the environment you're running the application in, without having
to modify the code.

For example, you may have different database credentials for your local development environment and for production.
Instead of hardcoding these credentials in the code, you can set them as environment variables and then reference them
in your configuration files.

The Spiral Framework integrates with `dotenv`, so you can store all your environment variables in a `.env` file at
the root of your project.

> **Note**
> If you're starting a new project, there's a `.env.sample` file that you can use as a guide.

Here is the example of available environment variables:

```dotenv
# Environment (prod or local)
APP_ENV=local

# Debug mode set to TRUE disables view caching and enables higher verbosity
DEBUG=true
VERBOSITY_LEVEL=verbose # basic, verbose, debug

# Set to an application specific value, used to encrypt/decrypt cookies etc
ENCRYPTER_KEY=...

# Monolog
MONOLOG_DEFAULT_CHANNEL=default
MONOLOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL=DEBUG # DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, ALERT, EMERGENCY

# Queue
QUEUE_CONNECTION=roadrunner

# Cache
CACHE_STORAGE=roadrunner

# Telemetry
TELEMETRY_DRIVER=null

# Serializer
DEFAULT_SERIALIZER_FORMAT=json # csv, xml, yaml

# Session
SESSION_LIFETIME=86400
SESSION_COOKIE=sid

# Authorization
AUTH_TOKEN_TRANSPORT=cookie
AUTH_TOKEN_STORAGE=session

# Mailer
MAILER_DSN=
MAILER_FROM="My site <no-reply@site.com>"
```

> **Note**
> Any variable in your `.env` file can be overridden by external environment variables such as server-level or
> system-level environment variables.

### Accessing Environment Variables

You can access these values using `Spiral\Boot\EnvironmentInterface`

```php
use Spiral\Boot\EnvironmentInterface;

class GithubClient
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly EnvironmentInterface $env
    ) {}
    
    public function getAccessToken(): string
    {
        return $this->env->get('GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN');
    }
}
```

or via a short function `env()`

```php
return [
    'access_token' => env('GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN'),
    // ...
];
```

## Configuration

Sometimes, you need to change parameters that can't be configured through environment variables. That's no problem,
because you can just change a config file for the specific component.

For example, you can change the default HTTP headers in `app/config/http.php`:

```php
return [
    'basePath'   => '/',
    'headers' => [
        'Server' => 'Spiral',
        'Content-Type' => 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
    ],
    'middleware' => [],
];
```

### Accessing Configuration Values

### Config objects

In the Spiral Framework, all config objects are injectable, which makes it easy to use them in your application.

```php
use Spiral\Http\Config\HttpConfig;

final class HttpClient 
{
    private readonly string $basePath;

    public function __construct(
        HttpConfig $config // <-- Container will automatically load values from app/config/http.php
    ) {
        $this->basePath = $this->config->getBasePath();
    }
}
```

Each injectable config class in the Spiral Framework contains
a [CONFIG constant](https://github.com/spiral/http/blob/master/src/Config/HttpConfig.php#L19) that defines the name of
the corresponding config file. When the container resolves an injectable config object, it automatically loads all
values from the config file and assigns them to the properties of the config object.

For example, for **HTTP config**:

```php
final class HttpConfig extends InjectableConfig
{
    const CONFIG = 'http';
    
    // ...
}
```

> **Note**
> See the reference for each component configuration in the related documentation section.
