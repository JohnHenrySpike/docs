# Overview â€” About

## Meet Spiral Framework

Spiral Framework is a High-Performance PHP/Go Full-Stack framework and group of over sixty PSR-compatible components.
The Framework execution model is based on hybrid runtime where some services (GRPC, Queue, WebSockets, etc.) are handled by
Application Server [RoadRunner](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner) and the PHP code of your application remains in
memory on a permanent basis (anti-memory leak tools included).
